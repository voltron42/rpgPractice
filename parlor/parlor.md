Parlor RPG
======

Parlor RPG is an rpg system meant to allow players to use common game pieces to play.

### Character stats: (playing cards)

* Vitality - (hearts)
* Acumen - (diamonds)
* Brawn - (clubs)
* Agility - (spades)

Character stats are set initially, and increase slowly with one's experience. When the player wishes to perform an action, a test is made against the appropriate stat. 

### Rechargeables: (Poker chips)

* Health -(red)
* Wealth -(white)
* Magic -(blue)

Rechargeables are those numbers which fluctuate frequently, and therefore need to track their changes.

### Effects: (6-sided dice)

Effects are transient numbers, that is, numbers that effect other numbers, like damage done by a weapon, spell or poison, restoration done by a friend, kit, food, or potion, or a change allowed by a price negotiation.

### Position: (Chessboard - optional)

In some cases, having a visual aid can make it easier to imagine placement and movement. I recommend using whatever you want or have on hand, but to make metrics easier, a chessboard makes sense.
